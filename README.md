# Code-Jam

This is a little practice project to get our workflow figured out. I have set up the very basics of a checkers game in kivy. There exists a kivy checkers game on gitHub already, but I haven't looked at it very closely. Please use the discord to suggest changes and choose what you want to work on. 

First we should focus on making the title, settings, and board screen. Then we can make moveable pieces, then two player LAN support, and finally include some sort of checkers AI library.

As always I am accepting of criticism and changes. 

Here is a resource I used already:
